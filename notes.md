* React creates a heirarchy of components in virtual DOM
* It then renders those components to the real DOM and inserts them where we tell it to
* `ReactDOM.render` takes two arguments -
    * What you want to render - `React Element`
    * Where you want to render - `DOM Element`
* `HelloWorld` is a component. In this case it is a _plain function_ or _functional_ or _stateless functional_ component
    * Another way of creating react components is ES6 classes
